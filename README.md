# surferJ

This is a WIP port of [surfer2](https://github.com/cgalab/surfer2) to Java. It's a triangulation-based straight skeleton algorithm â€“ the most powerful implementation out there.

But its concept is difficult, the algorithm is complex, the data structures are nasty and the original code is academic C++. Hopefully I'll get there...
